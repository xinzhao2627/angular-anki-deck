# angular-anki-deck
An anki deck for angular, based of on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Course - Angular: The Complete Guide 2025.
It features everything on the course, and will be continously updated for new contents or until I finish creating the deck.

## Includes:
- css style preset (with highlight.js for code snippet themes)
- front and back template
- the main angular apkg deck
- _(note: While reviewing cards, don't edit it in Ankidroid due to codeblocks being forcibly re-written. Instead do it in anki desktop)_

## card fields:
- Question (Front)
- Answer
- Code (code block or snippet)
- Use case
- Extra
- Tags
